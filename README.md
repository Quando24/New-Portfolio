# New-Portfolio 
## Description
This homework required me to update my web developer portfolio. My motivation was not only to continue to familiarize myself with the inner workings of html and css, but to also improve my familiarity of bootstrap. I built this assignment to learn how much detail goes into creating functioning websites and what the requirements are in order to design such a website to my liking, or anyone else's for the future. The problem solved concerns finding out what are the first steps in creating logical lines of code while at the same time, developing a website that is attractive and interactive as well. It is difficult as expected, but the more familiar I become with css and html, the better the product will be. I learned primarily how difficult it can be trying to place headers, texts, and images on a page due to my struggles with css and flexbox. On the flipside, this project, although difficult, is helping my development with using CSS as well as learning how to use flexbox and understanding the logical elements behind how a website is designed.

## Installation
Firstly, I have to place my work onto Github. In order to install the work onto Github, firstly you have to create an account. Then you have to create a new repository and give it a name. Be sure to make this new repository public and add a readme. Once that is done, there will be a green button, and once clicked, clone will be at the top with three options underneath. Click the ssh option. And then copy the link. Then go to the terminal. open the directory (type in ls) and then change into the specific directory (type in cd and the name of the directory) that you would like to place this project. Then you have to run a git add . command, followed by, a git commit -m "enter description of changes made" command. Then lastly run a git push command to publish the project onto Github.
